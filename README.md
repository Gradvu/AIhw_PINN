Welcome! This is my homework of Using PINN to solve a PDE.  
Here, files prefixed by "results" contain the graphs of losses and solutions.  
In files prefixed by "results", the files named models contain the parameters of models we had already trained well.  
The name of a file contains "L2" suggests that I used L2 normalization for training models in this files.  
The name of a file contains "Uniform" or "Normal" suggests that, I used Uniform or standard Normal distribution to 
initialize the weights and bias of models in this file.  
The name of a file contains "Again" suggests that, it was the second time to train models with specific parameters in it.
The python file "main.py" is the main file to run.
