Welcome! This is my homework of Using PINN to solve a PDE. 
Here, files prefixed by "results" contain the graphs of losses and solutions.
In files prefixed by "results" the file named models are the models we had already trained well.
The name of a file contains L2 suggests that I used L2 normalization in models in this files.
The name of a file contains Uniform or Normal suggests that I used Uniform or standard Normal distribution to 
initialize the weights and bias of models in this file.
The python file "main.py" is the main file to run.
